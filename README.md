## PyGhostal: A Space Ghost Coast to Coast Chat Bot

___
Project Overview:
"Building a quirky and conversational chatbot inspired by the iconic Space Ghost Coast to Coast, showcasing my Python
skills and interest in emerging language technologies."

### Technical Choices:

- Requests (HTTP interactions)
- BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)
- JSON (Data storage and interchange)
- Os (File system and path handling)
- SpaCy (If you continue using it for NLP)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyGhostal.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Explore the Data:** Examine the pre-scraped Space Ghost transcripts located in the `data` directory (JSON format).
4. **Run the Scripts:** Refer to comments within the `scripts` directory for instructions on how to utilize them for
   data processing, model training, or experimentation.

**Project Structure**

* `data`: Contains scraped transcripts in JSON format.
* `scripts`: Contains Python scripts for web scraping, data processing, and (future) model training.
* `models`: *Will hold trained language models*.
