Moltar and I don't work fifteen minutes a week to have you treat us like your servants. So you had just better start saving up your money, Buster Brown, because this is the last week I'm putting wear and tear on this cruiser when you can't even show a little appreciation for how hard we work! In fact, you know what I think? I think that maybe you need to get out there and find yourself a part-time job. Don't you have any skills? What do you like to do?"
