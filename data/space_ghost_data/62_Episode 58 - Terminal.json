I love you as much as I love anybody. I, I love you as much as I love myself. (piano music swells in background) In a few years when I haven't been around to be on your tail about something or irritating you, you're gonna remember. You're gonna remember the time I bought you the baseball glove, when you thought we were too broke. Or when I read you stories. When I let you goof off instead of mowing the lawn. Lots of things like that. And you're gonna realize that you loved me, and maybe you'll feel bad because you never told me. I know that you love me."
