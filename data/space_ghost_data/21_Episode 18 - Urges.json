I'll always remember that vile, near-poisonous gas you would emit when you were happy. And I'll never forget lunching with you in the commissary, watching you eat ten raw chickens and drink toner from the copy machine. You loved that toner. I know! We'll have a parade! (music changes to marching band music) We'll declare a national holiday on the Ghost Planet! With wonderful floats and big balloons, and we'll all drink fizzy lemonade, and eat Neapolitan ice cream!
