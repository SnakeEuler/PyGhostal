(family portrait with father, mother, two older siblings and baby Zorak; siblings dissappear one by one as Space Ghost speaks, followed by father's head) Born into a small family made even smaller by disgusting acts of cannibalism, you quickly entered into young bughood (police mug shot of Zorak in a leather jacket), and a life of evil."

      "dialogue": "Pest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Yep, he's a pesty insect pest. But shouldn't he have six legs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maxcy Nolan",
      "dialogue": "Well, they're supposed to have six legs; how many legs does Zorak have?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Two legs, um, two arms, kinda got a beak..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maxcy Nolan",
      "dialogue": "Is it possible that under that red vest (shot of Zorak in a blue vest) ... red vest (shot of Zorak in a red vest) he is carrying an extra set of arms, that no one has found out about yet."

      "dialogue": "Mmmmmm!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maxcy Nolan",

      "dialogue": "Why do you like these evil green things anyway?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maxcy Nolan",
      "dialogue": "One thing that I found just the most absolutely amazing about the mantises, is the fact that they can stand motionless, for hours. Literally not moving any body part that is visible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Zorak",
      "dialogue": "Actually, nobody moves much in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon."
    },

      "dialogue": "That's very interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Not really. Well, thanks for being with us, Mr. Nolan, and telling us all about... pests. Will we see you at Ye Olde Taco Shoppe after the big show?"
    },

      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Huh? I'll... take that as a maybe. (Dr. Nolan fades from the monitor) Okay, folks, next we have an old film clip of Zorak to show you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Zorak",
      "dialogue": "Ye gods! You're not gonna show that old thing, are ya?!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "That's right. We're going to see the first time I ever met our evil weevil little bug pal, and beat the living daylights out of him. It's called, simply, \"Zorak\". Enjoy!"

      "dialogue": "What have you done with Jan and Jace, Zorak?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Zorak",
      "dialogue": "(audience cheers) They are right here, Space Ghost. And, they are still alive, and they will stay that way if you follow orders. It's your life I want, not the hostages. (audience applause again)"
    },

      "speaker": "Space Ghost",

    },
    {
