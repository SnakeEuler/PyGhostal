Oh, it's your breathing recepticle! (laughs) (invisos to desk) I'm playful because I'm so deeply in love. My guests tonight include the ravishing radiant and most resplendant lady ever to grace this desperate lonely hovel, writer Merrill Markoe. As well as Hollywood's leading love authority Lee Majors. (looks at his card) Moltar, we can't have Lee Majors in here pawing my precious Merrill. What were you thinking?"

    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Yeah right. Adam, love is the universal language, and seeing as I'm not from your universe, I need your help. Will my relationship with Merrill suffer because of our differing gravitational backgrounds?"
