      "dialogue": "Oh, right, right, right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Penn Jillette",
      "dialogue": "They took this, this, uh, liquid nitrogen stuff and put it on it, and it was the first time I fainted from pain. It was right there..."
    },

      "speaker": "MOE 2000",
      "dialogue": "I fully functioned according to my programming, Tad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "No! You're supposed to help me out! Prompt the guest, make them feel comfortable, laugh at my jokes."
    },
