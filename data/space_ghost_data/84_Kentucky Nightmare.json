    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Are you slow? The alleged lie that you might have heard me saying, allegedly moments ago? That's a parasite that lives in my neck."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "He's probably going south, to mate with birds. (Turns to Willie) Bears are crazy, Willie. They'll bite your head if you're wearing steak on it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Okay, I'll just jump in here. Willie, who wrote the extremely famous phrase, \"A shark on whiskey is mighty risky. A shark on beer is a beer engineer\"?"

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "(Hiding behind Zorak's keyboard pod) Zorak, you must be secreting something that's attracting this bear!"
    },

      "speaker": "Zorak",
      "dialogue": "I haven't done anything! (Looks at camera) Heh heh, except for this. (Secretes a yellow cloud) Merry Christmas!"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Moltar",
      "dialogue": "(Sighs in disgust) Here, let me show you. (Throws lever, a video plays on his monitor, showing the cartoon bear walking in the woods.)"

      "dialogue": "Ah yes, my documentary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Bears and sharks always travel together. (The bear stands by a stream and growls, baring his teeth, while a shark floats by on its back) Just look at them, walking through the wooded forest, paw in fin. (The bear and the shark walk by. The camera suddenly pans up to bare tree branches.) It's on account of their teeth (Bear and shark start to growl and fight) that makes them \"Nature's Best Friends\" (Title appears in center of screen, as growling and fighting continue in background)"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "(To camera) I made this for public television, but they told me it was stupid and grossly inaccurate."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Zorak",
      "dialogue": "Hey, look at this! (Secretes a yellow cloud again) That's gonna carry all the way to the village. (Evil laugh)"
    },

      "speaker": "Moltar",
      "dialogue": "There ain't no village."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Space Ghost",

      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "(Flies back to his desk, carrying a six foot sub sandwich) I was too late. This is all that was left. Their six foot party sub. Their king, Randy, made it for me, while I waited. (Takes several bites out of the end of the sandwich, and talks with his mouth full) No one will ever know their way of life."

      "speaker": "Space Ghost",
      "dialogue": "Ow! (Space Ghost and the bear battle behind his desk, he pokes his head up) Shark, help... (The bear pulls him down again. The shark lies dormant on the studio floor. Space Ghost finally stands up). This is B.S., man. I'm gonna go see Doctor Worm and re-evaluate this merger. (The bear jumps him again)"

(Camera pans up to shark in a tree; it explodes with a bang) (Illustration of shark with firecrackers in its head, accompanied by the text labels \"Brains\" and \"Sex Organs\" with arrows) This is because sometimes their brains and sexual organs are made out of M-80's. (Dissolve to wooded scene with another shark) Sometimes, to attract mates, a shark will explode. (Shark explodes) (Several other sharks lying on the ground explode in sequence as the narration continues) And sometimes they explode just to attract giant killer bees."
